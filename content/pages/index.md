          Every Tuesday when I get my farm box I feel a little like a kid on
          Christmas morning. I can't help it! I love everything from the
          packaging to the smell and of course taste of everything I get.

          We like to plan our family's weekly meal schedule according to Farmer
          Joe's farm box . It's a fool proof method to make sure your food
          tastes great, even if you're not the greatest cook :)

          I found out about Farmer Joe from the restaurant I worked at, and we
          had such a great relationship with this vendor that I ended up
          becoming a personal customer and ordering boxes for my home as well.
