    title: Welcome to Our Family Farm
    content: >-
      We have purchased 30 achres of land from an elderly couple whose ancestors
      had a productive farm for over 6 decades. We fell in love with it
      immediately and vowed to uphold the same values and practices engrained in
      the land for generations. We continue the tradition by operating a family
      business that is focused on love and integrity to our earth, our
      community, and our customers.


      In our farm you will find:


      * Fresh vegetables and fruit, picked daily

      * Hormone-free chicken and free ranged eggs

      * Artisan cheese and cold cut, smoked meat


      We also collaborate with neighbouring farms to offer seasonal selections
      from their wonderful treasures so that you can get the largest variety of
      choices to enjoy.
